# badminton-vasooli
A simple Ionic App to keep track of badminton expenses among friends.
I built this app as I kept forgetting who owed me how much for our biweekly badminton sessions that I paid for.
To avoid the hassle of maintaining an excel sheet or making my friends sign up to Splitwise, I built this app.
It's very easy to tweak it a little bit and make it useful some other scenario.
The backend is built using firebase though and I have hence removed the credentials.
To Add your own credentials, add an environment.ts file in src/environment folder with your own firebase credentials and export it as environment constant.

## Enjoy!!
